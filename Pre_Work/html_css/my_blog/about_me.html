      <p>Since I was very young I liked computers. I always knew they were powerful machines. So I became to understand they were amazing tools, invented to help us. Then I had a dream: To know how they work, play with them and use them for helping people grow.</p>
      <p>In the next table I'm going to mention important moments, decisions or thoughts related that dream i had:</p>
      <div class="divtable">
